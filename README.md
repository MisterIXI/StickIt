This is the repository for the game jam game "Stick it" made in about 50 hours for the [Mini Jame Gam #15](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-16) by just one person (Yannik Br√§ndle aka MisterIXI).

# Jam rules and special object
The jams theme was **"Break the rules"** and the special object (to serve an important role in the game) was **"Duct Tape"**.

# Gameplay
In this little puzzle platformer you can stick everything moving down with sticky tape, but also cut the sticky tape to free them again.
